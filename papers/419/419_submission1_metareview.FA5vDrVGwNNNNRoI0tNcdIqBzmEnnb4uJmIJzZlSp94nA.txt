Decision: ACCEPT

Two out of three reviewers had problems submitting their review through the
system, which is why you only see one review on the paper page. I will send you
the other two reviews in a separate email and we will add them to the page too.

May I add my own two minor comments:

- You introduce the Semantic Web via the phrase "the W3C produced an
  international standard", while the Semantic Web is, as you also write further
  below a *collection* of standards.

- Your paper's scope is biomedicine, but this is not reflected by the title.
  Wouldn't a title like "Knowledge-Based Data Science in Biomedicine" be more
  accurate? But this is just a suggestion; I leave that to you.
