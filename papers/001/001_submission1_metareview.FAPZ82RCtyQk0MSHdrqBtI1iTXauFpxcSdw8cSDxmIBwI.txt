Decision: UNDECIDED

In particular, the following problems identified by the reviewers need to be addressed:

- Data availability: Your work does currently not follow our data availability requirements (see the paragraph on "Data" in the author guidelines: http://datasciencehub.net/guidelines.html)
- The problem of Research Question 1, as noted by Reviewer 2 ("not actually a real research question")
- Lacking discussion of implications, as noted by Reviewer 2
- Problems with the contagion part of the analysis, as noted by Reviewer 3
- Potential problems with the plots, as noted by Reviewer 3

Below I also list some very minor comments and typos from my side.

Typos and minor comments from my side (I might be wrong about some of the typos though):

- "1.2 million of these tweets was" > "... were"
- "The plot also introduce" > "... introduces"
- "We note how the connectivity growth dimension spans three orders of magnitude [...] This
means that some usersâ€™ followerships grows tens of times faster than the rate at which
they follow others": Shouldn't it be (at least) "hundreds of times faster"?
- I would be helpful if Figure 4 had labels for what the x and y axes stand for, instead of just "x" and "y".
- "significantly less tweets" > "... fewer ..."
- "similar amounts of retweets than broadcasters": not sure how to correctly phrase this but "similar ... than" sounds wrong to me
- "does not appear set of" > "does not appear in the set of"
